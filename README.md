# Decrease-and-Conquer

 Sorting an array of n integers using Decrease-and-Qonquer. D&Q means isolating an object, and using this object in its isolation to solve the problem. This code uses the 'Insertion sort' concept to sort an array. This way an integer gets picked from the array, and gets checked if its bigger or smaller then its predecessor. If it is smaller it gets 'inserted' at the index of its predecessor.
